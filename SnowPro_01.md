You're right! I missed embedding the diagram link properly in the response. Here's the complete combined explanation along with the **diagram link** for download:

### Snowflake Architecture Overview  

Snowflake is a data platform built on cloud-native principles, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. It is designed with three distinct layers:  

1. **Data Storage Layer**  
   - Stores structured and semi-structured data (e.g., JSON, Parquet, ORC) in a columnar format.  
   - This layer uses cloud storage from providers like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.  
   - Data is automatically compressed, partitioned, and distributed for optimal performance.  

2. **Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses)**  
   - This layer provides the computational muscle for executing queries, loading/unloading data, and other operations.  
   - Compute resources are provisioned as Virtual Warehouses (VW), available in T-shirt sizes (X-small to 6X-large). Each size doubles the resources (CPU, RAM, and storage) of the previous one.  
   - Features:  
     - **Vertical Scaling**: Increase the size (e.g., Medium to Large) for handling heavier queries.  
     - **Horizontal Scaling**: Add multiple warehouses for concurrency.  
     - **Auto Suspend and Resume**: Warehouses pause automatically after inactivity, saving costs.  
     - **Per-Second Billing**: Costs are based on usage duration and size.  

3. **Cloud Services Layer**  
   - Acts as the "brain" of Snowflake.  
   - Handles metadata management, query optimization, authentication, and access control.  
   - Includes features like:  
     - **Metadata Cache**: Speeds up query compilation using pre-stored statistics.  
     - **Result Cache**: Stores query results for up to 24 hours, reusing them for identical queries without additional compute cost.  

### Key Features of Snowflake  
- **Caching Mechanisms**:  
   - **Result Cache**: Speeds up identical queries by avoiding recomputation.  
   - **Warehouse Cache**: Reduces data retrieval costs by caching frequently accessed data within active warehouses.  
   - **Metadata Cache**: Optimizes query execution by storing data statistics and table schemas.  

- **Separation of Compute and Storage**:  
   - Enables independent scaling, providing flexibility to adjust resources as needed.  

- **Connection Methods**:  
   - **Web UI (Snowflake Web Interface)**: User-friendly interface for running queries and managing resources.  
   - **Snowsql (CLI)**: Command-line tool for interacting with Snowflake.  
   - **ODBC/JDBC Connectors**: For integrating with applications and third-party tools.  
   - **Native Connectors**: Python, Spark, and Snowpark for programmatic interactions.
